There is frequently a tension between simplicity and performance. 
When implementing a synchronization policy,
resist the temptation to prematurely sacrifice simplicity 
(potentially compromising safety) for the sake of performance.

Avoid holding locks during lengthy computations or operations
at risk of not completing quickly such as network or console I/O.
