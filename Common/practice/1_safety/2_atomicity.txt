UnsafeCountingFactorizer has several race conditions that make its results unreliable.
A race condition occurs when the correctness of a computation
depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads by the runtime;
in other words, when getting the right answer relies on lucky timing.
The most common type of race condition is check-then-act,
where a potentially stale observation is used to make a decision on what to do next.
