Underlying the structure of a database is the data model: a collection of conceptual
tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency
constraints. 

• Relational Model.
• Entity-Relationship Model.
• Object-Based Data Model. 
• Semistructured Data Model. 

DML
• Procedural DMLs require a user to specify what data are needed and how to
get those data.
• Declarative DMLs (also referred to as nonprocedural DMLs) require a user to
specify what data are needed without specifying how to get those data.
